I was usiing Patchpae2 fine on windows 8.1. Now I have upgraded to windows 10 and the program will not work anymore – say “wrong kernel level”. Will there be an update – or another way to use more that 2.75 GB on a 32 bit system?

Works great – thank you so much!

After getting the new boot entry like {12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-123456789abc},
you can copy your {…} to the associated commands in your personal “readme.txt”.
For example:
bcdedit /set {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx} kernel ntoskrnx.exe
becomes
bcdedit /set {12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-123456789abc} kernel ntoskrnx.exe
Then work with copy&paste to insert 100% correct commands to your Command prompt window.

I had the boot loop as well on 8.1. I just let it keep rebooting, eventually it worked after maybe 7 or 8 attempts. I made the mistake of having updates pending on the reboot. Thought that’s why it might have given problems. Seems fine now.

Installation was simple and straightforward.

I had dug up a similar patch (albeit way more complicated than this one!) under Win 7, and I hated going back to 3-something GB under Win 8 when I switched over. I am so happy being back at 4 GB now. Great job – thank you for your efforts and proving (once again) that all the Microsoft language about the 4GB limitation is just bullshit.

Patch works great…with one small problem: When the PC starts, sound almost always has various patterns of static and/or hash. (Rarely, sound starts w/o this.) Resetting Windows Audi Service one or more times (not consistent) clears it—the hash pattern changes with every service reset. AudioSrv.dll is byte-for-byte identical to correct MS version.

This is 8 GB on Win7 Home Premium—all other programs and functions work perfectly.

Any advice on how to solve the audio problem?

I’m seeing some folks talked about how they got stuck in a loop when they rebooted their machine after successfully installing the patch. I had the same problem. Never got it to work. I would get the blue screen with an error saying KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED. Eventually, I would get lucky and have a chance to choose to start the non patch windows. Anyone have luck resolving this?

It would seem that the patch can be affected by video drivers. It did not work using intel HD onboard graphics, neither did it work with a new Nvidia GEForce 610 card using the supplied video driver. It would work however using basic 640×480 VGA mode driver.

I got the patch to work perfectly by installing an older 2 year old GEForce 610 driver from another computer running Windows 7 for which the patch worked perfectly.

The recent update to Windows 8.1 (April 8) did not cause any problems.

Unfortunately, for me the patch stopped working after installing the 8.1 Update. ??

I had disabled/removed the patch before applying the 8.1 upgrade (just to be sure), then applied it again after the upgrade. When booting, I get a windows error (Windows 8-style blue screen) related to the video driver and the system freezes at that point.

I then downloaded the latest video drivers (nVidia GeForce), but that that doesn’t make any difference.

Too bad – I did like my 1 GB of extra memory! Anybody seeing same/similar issues …?

Hi PaVink, it may be worthwhile finding and installing older nvidia drivers, and see if the patch then works.
The Nvidia website has some older drivers.

If the patch works in safe mode, or when the Nvidia drivers are uninstalled and you use a standard VGA display, then it confirms a driver problem.

If you go through the comments on the Windows 7 page, (wj32 gives a link at the top of this page), the common failure theme is video drivers.

Hi.
After applying this patch to the new kernel ntkrnlpa.exe version 6.1.7601.18247 (win7sp1_gdr.130828-1532) Windows 7 after booting with the modified kernel goes to pseudo cyclo rebooting, specifically continuously displays shutdowning.
But this patch still works fine with the old kernel ntkrnlpa.exe version 6.1.7601.17514 (win7sp1_rtm.101119-1850) without any problems.

Yes, above are attached link to the older version of patched and successful worked kernel, but this kernel was used with the older Nvidia driver, so I believe that this problem isn’t in the kernel, this is more like a bugs in the latest GPU drivers such as Nvidia / Intel.

The patch works ok for me with Win8.1 + update 1 and “old” Nvidia drivers but if you have automatic updates set then your system may download and install updated video drivers which may be the cause of the problem.

Does this patch work only for ms windows, or along with practical apps like 3dsmax photoshop etc… I mean can other applications other than windows make the use of more than 4gb Like computer graphics apps for exemple?

Reply
Achraf52
November 16, 2014 at 1:48 pm
Not really, any given application can only use maximum 4GB using this trick, because pointer address sizes are still 4 bytes long (not 8 bytes like in Windows 64 bit versions) which means a program like Adobe Photoshop can only access a maximum of 4.2 Billion memory addresses, even though there’s more left unused and can be assigned by Windows to other applications.
If you have 8GB and you use PAE then you can run Adobe Photoshop for example and use 4GB maximum and Adobe Illustrator and use the rest (roughly 3GB) at the same time.

I have applied the patch on a Windows 7 Ultimate SP1, but I cannot find a “PAE compatible” nVidia driver (I have a Quadro FX 580). Lots of artifacts and after a while BSODs appear (when using modified kernel), related to graphics drivers. I have read some were lucky with older nVidia drivers…so I would like to know which driver versions are confirmed to work perfectly while in PAE-enabled kernel mode. Thank you very much in advance, GABRIEL.

September 6, 2014 at 6:37 pm
You will probably need to go to the Nvidia website, driver downloads page, click on ‘Beta and Older Drivers’ put your Quadro FX 580 details into the boxes and click Search.

http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx

They appear to have Beta drivers for your card going back as far as 2009.
You could try these and see if the patch works.

It will be very much trial and error.

In my case I found the driver for the GE Force GT610, dated 2/10/2012 version 9.18.13.697 which I already had for an older version of GT610, worked OK, whereas the newer version which came on the disk with a new video card was dated sometime in 2013 didn’t work.

September 30, 2014 at 6:46 pm
You don’t actually type ‘WherePatchPaeIs’, instead of that you type the directory where you put PatchPae2.exe.
I assume that is why the system cannot find the path specified, but excuse me if I am wrong ??

In my case I put it in C:\Windows\System32, but you could put it anywhere, as long as it isn’t in a place where it could get deleted, such as a temporary folder.

Haha Terry, I doubt that would help my case. My system has only 4GB of RAM so this patch would have proved efficient to my setup.

If I switch to x64 it will be pointless cause from I’ve gathered, the x64 version will actually use more RAM, for example some folks were talking about x64 taking about 1.2/4 GB of RAM at idle, while the x86 takes around 6/700MB.

From my own conclusion I would suspect that to be true, because for an x86 app. to run on x64, there will be 2 instances in RAM? …

Anyway I will have tot test this out for sure.

Wow, this patch rocks. So simple to apply and it WORKS. (Just copy and paste from the “read me” text file so little room for error.) The only “problem”, if you can call it that, is one of the two patches kept prompting windows to repair itself. (Deleted that patch since repair wasn’t successful.) The only thing that could be improved is being able to copy and paste the long { } string. I’ll know how much more improvement I’ve gained once my 8GB ram chips arrive. But for now, things seem to run faster than before.

So this may be a matter of not looking a gift horse in the mouth and just accepting the excellent results. Thanks again.

If Properties page says that only 3GB is available, then it means the patch has not been applied. It should just say “Installed memory (RAM): 8.00 GB”

It may pay you to go through the procedure again.

January 24, 2015 at 2:50 pm
Keith, I would carefully go through the steps again for Windows 7, being sure you don’t inadvertently use any Windows 8 only instructions. I’d suggest you put PatchPae2.exe into C:\Windows\System32\, and that is what you type where it says “C:\WherePatchPaeis\”, ie the path to where you put PatchPae2.exe.

The re-typed commands will overwrite any you have already made.

One or two people have thought that you type “WherePatchPaeis”  ??

It is easy to make a mistake in typing out the commands, copying the string to the clipboard at step 5 is a great help as it has to be entered a few times.

If you get it right, then either the patch will work and you will get the full 8GB…hurrah…, or it wont ?? and your computer may hang or get a black screen.

If it hangs try restarting in safe mode and remove the patch via msconfig as it describes in the readme file.

If it doesn’t work then there is probably some hardware conflict or a device trying to write into the memory space above 4GB. Have a read through the comments.

Thanks again, will repeat step. Patch is in Windows\system 32 already. For whatever reason, the addition of another 4GB of RAM and your patch does seem to make my laptop a lot snappier. Dell e4300, 64GB SATA 3, SSD and 300GB SATA 3, HDD. Windows 7 SP1, OEM version. No BSODs in any event.

If Windows reinstall the update automatically, you need to set Windows Updates to notify you before installing updates instead of automatically installing them.

To do this follow these steps:

Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Update : Change Settings (upper left) then select either:

Never check for updates (and you will have to manually do this once in a while, like once or twice a month)
or
Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install

This patch doesn’t replace the files, instead it copies them and patches the copies, then ads a new boot entry pointing to the patched files.

You should re-read what this patch does and try to understand how it works before continuing.

doing it the old fashioned way with a hex editor also does not end well. the 7C11 8B45 & 7C10 8B45 flags are still there, but the rest of the string is significantly different. It still signs and It all looks well and good though until you get to windows. Windows boots slowly, shows even less available ram, and does not “have enough free memory to open” ANYthing… even notepad…

Dear Mr. Liu,

First, Thank You for providing the patch; it works perfectly on our 7 and 8x systems.

We are planning to upgrade to windows 10 in the near future and we assume the new OS will change/upgrade the kernel. Is that correct?

If yes, can we use the patch on the windows 10 OS?

If not, will you be releasing a windows 10 version?

Many thanks again for your service.

So, you say I should trust your code. Let’s have a look.

Chrome and IE refuse to download it, because of the trojan alert. Using wget, I can retrieve the file; again the scanner detects the trojan and deletes the .exe from inside the zip. Disabling that, 7zip then refuses to unzip the enclosed .exe, because it too detects the trojan.

Shutting down all scans, I finally uncompress everything. Here’s what I get:

6 DLL’s, all of which begin with HAL.
31 SYS files, 27 of which begin with USB, and the rest with HID.
A handful of other files and directories — 4 EXE’s, and directories named 2003 and 2008__.

And: your VBS file — 8100+ lines of code, a thousand of which are in Russian.

Ok. 31 *.sys files.

They are in ZIP 2003\SYSTEM32\drivers\ directory (not SFX!).
Windows XP has some troubles with USB 2.0 in PAE-mode. This drivers from server 2003 for replace XP drivers when fix128 installed on XP. After uninstall fix128 on XP, it replace with original backup XP files. You can read http://www.overclock.net/t/77229/windows-xp-ram-limit/50 for more information about usbvideo.sys, usbstor.sys, etc. Heh, you say Server 2003 is malware. You are joking too.

Similar to 2008\SYSTEM32\drivers\ directory. But 2008 is renamed to ___2008 and is not used. I found some windows-7 with beta-SP1 systems needing replacement of original usb2 drivers too. it’s experimental future and in russian manual it isn’t recommended (and 2008 is renamed to ___2008). This *.sys files from… Server 2008. You just say Server 2008 is malware. Great.

at installation the fix128 copies files from 2003|2008 automatically in windows.

next, 6 DLL…

When you patch Windows XP, you need to patch HAL. And modified patchpae2 can do it.
Another way is to copy HAL DLL from XP SP1, wich supports more then 4 Gb of memory.
http://www.overclock.net/t/77229/windows-xp-ram-limit/60#post_22142268. I tested this method, but it’s not working with my system. And it isn’t recommended in russian manual. This method activated only if you run fix128.exe with +XPSP1HAL key in command line.
6 DLL’s in xpsp1hal directory, all of which begin with HAL is HAL drivers from XP SP1. And you just say Windows XP SP1 is malware. You are more joking.

There is 2 way to load patched (i.e. with damaged signature) kernel. 1 – you can patch loader to disable signature verification (PatchPae2.exe -type loader …). 2 – original method by Geoff Chappell based on test-signing. http://www.geoffchappell.com/notes/windows/license/memory.htm And fix128.exe has key +TestCert to use this method. You need some utils from Visual Studio for 2nd method: makecert.exe, certmgr.exe and signtool.exe. It is in utils directory of SFX archive. You just say Visual Studio is malware. You are more and more by more joking.

I am using an old Nvidia graphics driver as newer ones caused problems when patching Windows 7 and 8.1 with wj32’s patch. That is a problem in itself, Windows 10 has to be set so that it doesn’t automatically install the latest drivers.  ??

Next test will be to see if up to date video drivers will work, though I am not too hopeful.

Many thanks

So… patch v.039 working fine and smooth. After few days of test and experiments i can say it’s GREAT and WORKING ! So i made and test this scenario:

1. Make virtual machine KVM on CentOs 7.1 Linux and patched Windows 10 Enterprise 32bit-10240RTM
2. Make full machine backup with EaseUs ToDo Backup 6.1
3. Restored backup to VmWare virtual machine on Windows 8.1
4. Restored backup on VirtualBox machine on Windows 7 32 bit
5. Restored machine on bare metal

Patch is there all the time and work great, even different video drivers on different VM’s.
Today tested patched machine with 7 all day connected user over RDP /thinstation clients/ and it working fine and stable!

Many thanks to evgeny for great work and sharing knowledge!

However, I still can’t trust it, until reasonable explanation why ALL of the used software says it is infected. There’s obviously something in the code, which is causing it. C’mon man, just reveal it and we’ll use your patch.

evgeny, why not simply uploading the _source code_ of PatchPae2 CLI, enhanced for Windows 10 too? The code is well structured, well documented for all supported different kernel versions.

Then, you could also simply use the old plain safe .zip format instead of SFX if you don’t have nothing to hide…

You may download 7zip

You can open sfx-archive fix128.exe by 7zip.
You can extract the file fix128.exe\utils\main.c with _source code_ of PatchPae2 CLI, enhanced for Windows 10
You can extract the file fix128.exe\utils\PatchPae2.exe CLI binary, enhanced for Windows 10, which I uploaded above
You can extract the file fix128.exe\ntk128gb.vbs with _source code_ of GUI
I could encrypt VBS, archive, etc, but I didn’t.
You may read all, but you didn’t.
Why?
You are f_ck*ng Writer, not reader.
Why are you can’t read the _source code_? You have not a notepad? Are you banned on 7zip download page? Maybe you’re too lazy?
What problem?
The _source code_ always was here.

Well, if you keep answering like this and you keep insisting to us to download your file without any explanation why, then trust me, no one’s going to do it. Your comments are now becoming a spam without a purpose. If you really want to help, then do it. EXPLAIN. Give us a reason. So we can believe that 99% of anti-malicious software is wrong. Don’t expect anyone to read 8100+ lines of code. Or simply make a clean new patch when you know what is causing it.

There’s hardly a browser in the world, which won’t say file contains a virus. Not even talking about how to open it, because things are getting even more difficult. It looks like the easiest way to reach your patch is to install some “insensitive” OS maybe or what? Just to sit down and read 8000 lines of code, seriously???

It is very difficult to you to understand, that (open sfx in archive program) != (start *.exe-file). Ok.
It is very difficult to you to understand, that modified main.c has 2000+ lines of code, not 8000+ and the original main.c has 900+ lines of code. Real dude won’t read nor 8000, nor 2000, nor 900 lines of code, I guessed?

Stop trying to blame others for their incompetence. Instead of doing this, just fix your archive. It’s BAD and it doesn’t matter if it’s a 99% false alarm or a real virus. Of course I can open and analyze it through disabling all protections, using some unheard of browser, going in safe mode, or just on my Linux, but should I do it? Should really anyone be doing it just to install your patch? I hope that’s not the case. Make it simple and we won’t be suspicious.

Extract to a folder, run Autorun.cmd as administrator to install PAE patch.
You can re-run the Autorun.cmd later, when the kernel gets updated.

some laptops has double boot (and more) with win8, win7, etc (bcdedit /enum ^| find “ntkrnlpx.exe” won’t work). maybe {current}?
imho it will be better and faster: FOR /F %%a in (‘ver | find “6.3.9600”‘) do set windows=8.1

and… testsigning? u can’t load system from UEFI, etc, watermark…

and will be better to use “bcdedit /set {guid} bootmenupolicy legacy” for win8+ (especially with NVidia drivers)

Reply

September 3, 2015 at 9:47 am
The bcdedit /enum ^| find “ntkrnlpx.exe” only is there to find out if the patch has
already been applied, and the script will grab the current boot entry using:
bcdedit /copy {current} /d “Windows %windows% (PAE)”.

I don’t think the watermark is a big issue, but maybe a patched loader is a better way?

I should also add the following after adding the boot entry, it will just fail on Windows 7:
bcdedit /set {%newguid%} bootmenupolicy legacy >nul 2>&1

The reason I wanted to keep bcdedit /enum {current} ^| find “Windows 7”
is to make sure the patch works is version is changed in windows …

6.1.7600 – Windows 7
6.1.7601 – Windows 7 SP1

6.3.9200 – Windows 8.1
6.3.9600 – Windows 8.1 SR1
10.0.10240 – Windows 10

Could also do this …

FOR /F “tokens=4” %%g in (‘ver’) do set winver=%%g
FOR /F “delims=. tokens=1,2” %%g in (‘echo %winver%’) do set winver=%%g%%h
if %winver% gtr 61 set kernel=ntoskrnl.exe

Good points …

1) choice would be better than ping.
2) I packed it below in self extract that forces admin rights, so I don’t need to check.
3) x64 will fail, as it will not find bcdedit (x32 process on x64) but even if it did run it
would exit: %errorlevel% neq 0 echo – ERROR, Cannot patch %kernel%! & goto end

2) yes, i saw it, i can read;)

1. you can disable UAC:

and restart your PC
2 you can login with user-access account
3 run your exe and it will fail.
in this case you will never become administrator-account.
many people disable UAC

3) i think message “x64 not support…” is better and more informative than “something missing”.

Yes, I saw that it was your post also and you are 100% right. By the way you also have to stop Windows update from downloading drivers otherwise it automatically downloads the latest Nvidia driver and breaks it again. So basically you have to do everything possible to ensure it doesn´t update from the 332.21.

Yes, I usually remove all folders from Nvidia drivers, except Display.driver, Hdaudio, Nvi2,

Little off topic but I disassembled nvlddmkm.sys and 332.21 calls halTranslateBusAddress,
but a newer 334.89 no longer includes such a call whatsoever. Something they’ve changed
with how memory is being addressed I’m guessing. Causing the PAE crash.

for nvidia drivers in Windows 10 with PAE.

howto: install old driver version and prevent installation of newer version of driver.

1. you must temporarily stop and disable the “Windows Update” service. you may do it from “Computer Management”-Services-“Windows Update”,
but faster way is:
run Command Prompt as Administrator and enter
sc stop wuauserv
sc config wuauserv start= disabled

2. Now Windows Update is stoped. And we can remove all files and subdirectories in c:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution.
Downloaded updates and drivers are caching in this directory before install and windows automatically remove it after install.
And we now remove all new drivers for NVidia too.

We must delete the C:\NVidia directory too.

3. Run “Device Manager”.
Go to “Display adapters”, select NVidia and uninstall it. In “Confirm Device Uninstall” dialog you must activate the “Delete the driver
software for this device” option!

we deleted all copies of driver.

4. Click Action-“Scan for hardware changes” in “Device Manager”. You will see something like “Micro$oft Basic Display Adapter” in “Display adapters”
(or hardware without driver).

5. Now you can install old NVidia driver with PAE support.

6. prevent installation of newer version of driver… before this you need to know HardwareId of your NVidia adapter.
Double click “Micro$oft Basic Display Adapter” (or any hardware to prevent new installation), open the “Details” tab and
select property “Hardware Ids”. Then copy any value you like. For example, PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_1341&SUBSYS_381A17AA

7. Run gpedit.msc in Command Prompt.
Go to “Local Computer Policy”-“Computer Configuration”-“Administrative Templates”-“System”-“Device Installation”-“Device Installation Restrictions”-
“Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs”
Click Enabled, then click Show.
In the “Show Contents dialog” window, paste previously copied HardwareId of your NVidia adapter. Click OK.
Next, click OK to save your changes in “Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs” window.

https://technet.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/cc732727.aspx

8. enable and start the “Windows Update” service.
run Command Prompt as Administrator and enter
sc config wuauserv start= auto
sc start wuauserv

9. Now Windows can’t install any another driver for your NVidia adapter. Yes!

Excellent instructions, too bad we never will be able to install

from russian forum:
1)
Windows can release another newer version of driver, and we will have BSOD.
2)
This f*uck_ing tool doesn’t show already installed updates. f*uck_ing Windows automatically installs this f*uck_ing updated driver, and we have no time to hide it.

We can uninstall new driver in “Device Manager” but in some seconds f*uck_ing Windows automatically install this f*uck_ing driver, and we have no time to do something.

We can’t uninstall this new driver-update becouse Windows not show it in programs/updates (or Windows Update download and install it in some seconds).

I solved the Nvidia driver problem by getting an ATI Radeon video card, and removing the Nvidia GEForce, ??

So far I have had no problems with my Win 8.1 computer, but it has only been patched a little while.

My computer with Windows 10 and which also has an Nvidia card has had driver updates disabled and Nvidia update in particular, hidden. The driver I’m using dates back to 2012 and doesn’t cause any problem.

It is a bit difficult to stop W10 updating video drivers, but it can be done

Unfortunately I just tried 355.82 as well as 355.98 on a fresh install of Win 10 x32,
and just as expected they both crash. You possibly either have an older driver version,
or you’re running x64 edition, or somehow a GTX 650 works, but my GT 620 doesn’t.

Or you were using a display hooked up to another non nvidia adapter. Don’t know ??

I’m assuming you can still boot using the non-patched boot menu entry?

Check what version of nvidia or intel drivers you have installed after you boot,
most of the new ones won’t work or just crash.

Yes, I can boot using the non-patched menu. My intel driver for the display is quite old (version 8.15.10.2900 on 26/11/2012).

Strange, could try removing the driver to see that’s the cause …

Luke,
You can probably use any AMD/ATI graphics card that is within your price range, and use the driver which is for that card. If you buy new, then there will be a driver CD with the card.

I’m assuming you are using a desktop machine, if you have a laptop, then there isn’t much you can do about fitting a video card AFAIK.

I do not think that it’s an option… it’s from “XP time” that Intel has removed the PAE support on their driver…
Personally on my HP laptop I’m still running Seven (and I do not think I will upgrade to 10 anytime soon!!!!) with a modded XP driver.

Well, nvidia 332.21 is the last one that works, from January 2014, so not really XP days …
Basically Server 2008 Enterprise x86 would be affected by this, as it supports PAE 64GB,
but I guess since nvidia doesn’t officially support 2008 any longer, they don’t care.

I also seem to have trouble with the Windows 10 version 1511 upgrade. Firstly the ‘old’ Nvidia driver from 2012 that I was using before the upgrade will now longer install.

Then with this Windows version winload.exe will not patch, it gives a failed error message.

Escape75.
First I tried PatchPae2.exe from evgeny, and it patched the kernel with no error message, but it failed at patching winload.exe. It did however produce a winloadp.exe file, but I didn’t go any further, especially as I knew the nvidia driver that Win 10 installed would cause failure anyway.

Then I tried your PAEPatch.rar file and it failed at trying to patch winload.exe.

So I guess we hope evgeny may come up with another fix in due course.

The link I posted uses PatchPae2 v040 RC0 so it should also fail.
It’s nothing more than a self extracting file above plus script, and this
line should make it abort and exit, if it succeeds it creates winloadx.exe:

Patchpae -type loader -o “%systemroot%\system32\winloadx.exe” “%systemroot%\system32\winload.exe” >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (echo -ERROR- Cannot Patch winload.exe!) & (goto end)

Your Google is obviously in error, there is nothing malicious in the file, but it does modify the kernel. I downloaded the file from evgeny’s link with no alarm bells from either Google or Windows Defender.

Files like this that modify the system [i]can[/i] cause false positives in anti virus software, they have done so even back in MSDOS days.

Many thanks both. We are back in business again.

Hello,

I am struggling to install XP driver on Vista. I have HP 6530b with Mobile 4 Series Express Chipset Family (GMA 4500MHD?) card but the Vista driver is buggy as well. Unfortunately the XP driver has no such section in INF file, like the one for HD driver, only
[Manufacturer]
%Intel% = Intel.Mfg

[Intel.Mfg]

%iCNTG0% = iCNT0, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2A42
%iCNTG1% = iCNT1, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2A43
%iEGLG0% = iEGL0, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E02
%iEGLG1% = iEGL1, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E03
%iEGLQ4G0% = iEGL0, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E12
%iEGLQ4G1% = iEGL1, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E13
%iEGLG4G0% = iEGL0, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E22
%iEGLG4G1% = iEGL1, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E23
%iEGLGVG0% = iEGL0, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E32
%iEGLGVG1% = iEGL1, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E33
%iEGLGB0% = iEGL0, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E42
%iEGLGB1% = iEGL1, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E43
%iEGLGBU0% = iEGL0, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E92
%iEGLGBU1% = iEGL1, PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_2E93

Nothing related to Vista or XP, so cannot make any change in it. Setup ends with error that driver is not validated for this computer and I should use driver from computer manufacturer, but if I use the XP driver from HP I am getting just the same error.
I tried to update the driver via device manager but Vista decides that it already has the newest driver. I tried to uninstall the driver but still I have some apparently pre-installed Intel driver 7.15.10.1488 and above actions end in the same way. Am I out of luck with this crap graphic card?
Maybe it is because the drivers have different names? Vista has igdkmd32.sys and for XP it is igxpmp32.sys. I would appreciate your comments.

No, please don’t forget about your privacy. The “disable” options in this matter works wrongly in Windows 10. It is intentional. Please also read “more” in microsoft privacy policy (aka.ms/privacy). You also will never be true administrator of your computer using windows 10.
Administrator of your computer with windows 10 is M$. All interference into system can be undo by system. This system is not stable without patching so…

If you have Professional or Enterprise version of Win10, probably you can downgrade to windows 8.1 (read EULA) and patch it. Pay attention during use of Windows update on Win7 and Win8.1 (telemetry; auto-update to windows 10 aka GWX.exe).

Thank you. The Patch works properly but please add comment for windows 8.1: After selection of non-default Windows 8.1 Patched the computer will show black screen during a few seconds and restart. After restart there will be loaded patched system. I have 4GB of RAM. Before patch: 1.97GB free, after: 3.20GB free.

I switched default boot item after testing to patched version.

Why M$ blocks the PAE function? There shall be possible to enable with warning “not all devices/drivers support it. You use this option at your own risk”.
