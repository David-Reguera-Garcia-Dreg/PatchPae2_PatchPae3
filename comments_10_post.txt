I removed the Evgeny\Escape75 patch for Win 10 (see:https://wj32.org/wp/2013/10/25/pae-patch-updated-for-windows-8-1/ around November 2015), and applied this one by wj32 to check it out.

Works fine foe me on Windows 10 Home with all latest updates. No problems or error messages.

Intel HD and Nvidia graphics are known issues. If you have either of these in a PC and you want to use the patch, then it is best to use another video card with different chipsets, eg ATI Radeon.

I’ve tried to install this patch numerous times and using the latest 3 updates. I have nvidia card, and with the patch booted in screen froze with ‘windows shutting down’, yet when I start the parch in safe mode, it boots fine, and shows all my 8 gb ram. in task manager. It appears to be a video card issue as I know it works with the default vga driver in safe mode.

Is there going to be any more work on this? Thank you.

The only way you will get the patch to work is to replace your video card with one having other than Nvidia chipsets, eg ATI Radeon , as already mentioned.

Still trying. I’ll try the very newest patch today or tomorrow. On the patch boot, after the normal animated windows loading screen I get half a correct windows ‘welcome’ screen and jagged half white image with little diamonds and weird patterns and no movement. Must hit reset button. Again, in safe mode, I see all 8 gigs and runs fine. Misconfig has memory unchecked as well. Maybe I could try going back 2 years in nvidia graphics drivers… they only have been adding support for 3d and physics, both of which I don’t use…Worth a try maybe.
Any thoughts?

WARNING!!

There’s fair chance this site has been compromised to some extent.

This new Windows 10 version of the patch is seen as heavily infected by anti-malware scanners.

If you use the Internet Archive Wayback Machine you can download the older versions of the patch (before someone replaced the link URL’s to direct people to the new infected patch).

Those older versions scan completely clean.

The original author of the patch spoke perfect English but the guy claiming to the be author and defending the infected patch in the comment section (using the name evgeny) speaks English poorly.

I looks like he may have the ability to upload infected files but not the ability to disable or remove negative/revealing comments.

It’s also possible that, in the process of making the patch work with Windows 10, legitimate changes needed to be made that trigger heuristics flags in anti-malware scanners. It’s also possible that the older versions also used to trigger those flags but have since been cleared as producers of false positives in the anti-malware databases.

In conclusion, if this new patch it legitimate and not actually infected, I apologize, but there are too many red flags here and I don’t have the C knowledge to check the source code, or the tools to recompile it for comparison. So, I’ll be sticking with the older versions accessible via the Wayback Machine.

You are getting confused. The (unofficial) Win 10 pae patch by evgeny who AFAIK is Russian, has nothing to do whatsoever with this site owner’s (wj32) patch. The patches are completely separate and independent of one another. The evgeny patch for Win 10 was posted before the latest wj32 Win 10 patch became available.

However I have used both with no problems and with no virus’s showing up in either.

The file link posted by escape75 back in November is an executable program that uses the evegeny patch for win 10 and installs it automatically, no manual input is required except to run the program.

evgeny (who I do not have any affiliation with) does not have the ability to upload files to my website. I have not deleted negative comments such as yours because doing so serves no purpose to me.

Once again, there is no virus in the file. AV heuristics naturally come up with false positives. This is one of them.

Unfortunately it crushes into BSOD “SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED” on start, so Windows can’t even dumb anything.

If you are having the same issue, uninstall physical RAM — then you will be able to boot and disable this modification.

Okay, First, this wj32 and patch has been around quite some time and appears to be the most dependable, robust and actively updated one.
There are no viruses in any of this code, but due to how it’s accessing kernals (with your permission) a decent virus/malware should detect something. This is normal, but it’s actually good people pay attention to this sort of thing.
From all my reading and experimenting, I will submit there’s a nvidia and other graphic driver problems.
I’m going to try loading some legacy win XP graphic drivers and test if there’s a different screen upon booting the pae boot option.

I am going this route before screwing around with microsoft updates and such. I believe it’s entirely possible that microsoft has put in code to distrupt this patch from working as they want people to buy another OS like the 64 bit. It’s all marketing as far as I’m concerned. Why else would larger memory work on win 2000 and some other older win OS’s natively and not the newer ones. I feel just reloading graphic drivers has much less potential for problems.

I will report when I’ve got something concrete to say.

I had to use a restore point after messing with too many graphic drivers and created another unrelated issue to the patch.. after fixing my created problem, I read to check for any ram type 3rd party or memory managers running at the same time as pae. I forgot I had a ram drive program resident from before. I disabled that and when I did second paepatch boot option I saw a lower res windows screen and it comes up ‘windows doing repair’ and it attempts to repair. I cancel and reboot with same thing in loop.
This is different than when the ram program was running so maybe I’m getting somewhere.
I will try the nvidia drivers from 2012 or so for win 7, this time with a restore point…
will update results. Always ALWAYS make sure to install this as a second boot option.

wj32 clearly designed an excellent almost fool proof program by giving you the dual boot option…USE IT!!!

I followed instructions and it failed to patch the Windows Loader on Windows 7 Professional 32 bit with SP1 (4GB RAM). I just get the Failed message after trying to patch the loader but patching the kernel is fine. I looked in the source code and I guess some hex codes weren’t lining up which is why it didn’t patch properly? Any way we can resolve this issue?

Then C:\WherePatchPaeis etc.. , Do you mean I have to change directory from System32 back to C:? Also and since I am not a computer wiz, do I copy the whole command line “PatchPae2.exe -type kernel -o ntoskrnx.exe ntoskrnl.exe ” as is after changing to the patch directory?
I have Windows 10 pro, and the message I am getting is: “unable to copy file: The system cannot find the file specified.” Can you please help? I need specific instructions step by step please. Thanks a million

No, check and make sure it is c:/system32 means that inside command prompt window you will actually read the line displaying: “C:/system32>” at this point you indeed copy/paste the whole line exactly as you wrote and press “Enter”.
Remember the command prompt must be with admin rights (right-click the cmd icon and choose “execute as admin”) and remember to substitute the path where you actually have your patchpae2 folder.
Hope it helped…sorry for bad english ??

This patch did not work for me, seems to be just a skin, space engineers for example need 8GB of RAM to run, I can not even load a world, the game closes before for lack of memory, when I have 8GB on my pc and not can not install 64-bit due to driver incompatibility (gives BSOD) so I’m using this patch, but appears to be a skin as it did no good to me, it is the same thing as being with 4GB of RAM.

I just found out that this doesn’t work for Windows 10 LTSB build 14393. The kernel and winload are different in size, as compared to CB kernels. So in fact the patch only copies the two files without any changes being made to the files itself.
I guess the patch checks the checksum, if it doesn’t match no patching is done.
The patcher however says “patched”, incorrectly so.
Evgeny, can you add support for LTSB builds?

Viktor, you are using patchpae2.exe, this does not work with build 14393.

Use patchpae3.exe downloadable from the evgeny post dated 16 August,

With the latest batch of Windows 10 updates, people may find they have to run “step 3” again to ensure the latest version of the kernel is installed. You will probably have to run unpatched windows in order to get Windows to load.

I started the last windows update. The kernel was updated from 14393.103 to 14393.187. After this, I got a reboot loop. I solved the problem as follows:
– Boot without PAE patch.
– Patch the new kernel 14393.187
– Reboot with PAE patch.
After this, everything works fine.

I installed this patch after upgrading to Win 10. At the “Anniversary Update” (1607) the computer crashed and I reinstalled everything. With today’s update I again got the BSOD, but this time (after enduring all of MS’s attempts to recover the PC) I chose the non-patched Win 10 and it booted up (without full use of 8 GB of RAM). The update knocked out ntoskrnx.exe, but left winloadapp and the boot option. I followed directions to remove the patch leftovers and now will reinstall it (with thanks to B-Lex for assurance that this version of the patch works with the new update). SO: apparently any update that modifies the kernel will require (1)booting to Win 10 plain, and (2) reinstalling the PAE3 patch. The BSOD will let you know.

I applied the patch and booted in with 4gb of Ram, it sees 4 gb, it recognizes 4 gb, but it won’t go past 3.2gb when I try to fill up the ram on Windows 10 14393. Can anybody else confirm this? Can you use more than 3.2gb of ram even if it shows you have Xamount-3.2gb ?

Reply

October 22, 2016 at 1:37 pm
boogie,
You need to check whether the patch has actually been applied.
Either right click ‘This PC’ icon on desktop and then Properties, or Settings-System-about and check installed RAM. It should say 4GB.

If it says some something like 4GB installed, 3.2GB useable, then the patch has not been correctly applied.

You can’t actually use all of the 4GB of RAM installed because Windows requires some for overheads, and if you have onboard video, then some more of that 4GB will be used for video memory.

The other thing to realise is that only 4GB of ram will be used by any one program, even though there may be say, 8 or more GB installed

Nah it’s my bad. It’s just that windows 32bit actually doesn’t let me use over 2.2gb actually which is very weird for me and it leaves 1 gb available and after applying the patch it uses that extra 800 mb to get 3.2 but once again 900 mb available. So the patch works but Windows is acting weird because on my 64bit version I can fill up the ram until I have 200mb left

Hey community,
what is your experience when you use USB devices on PAE patched OS?

I found out, that for me connecting USB devices fails every time I boot PC with PAE.
PC note that device is attached, but init of driver fails. In settings, under devices, I found note: Driver error.

When I boot PC without PAE, USB devices works.
My kernel 14393.351.

Dear developer(s), it is possible to resolve this issue?

I’m running kind of a complex setup. A little background, my motivation stems from ACT! 2008 not being installable on 64-bit OSs. So, I loaded it on a Windows 10 Enterprise x86 Hyper-V VM along with RDP Wrap, RemoteApp Tool, and PatchPAE3. All successful. I published the app with RemoteApp, the system shows that it has 8GB of RAM and I have 6 users using it simultaneously from their PCs.

The problem is, once the system hits between 3.0 and 3.2 GB of RAM used (the system, as a whole, has never gone past 3.2 GB used), new connections start bombing out with an RDP protocol error of 0x112f. Looking it up seems to point to memory restrictions on the host PC. So, I don’t know if PatchPAE3 isn’t working or if a Windows behavior regarding memory allocation to a single exe even if there are multiple instances of it (so, like a shared pool per exe even if there are six of them running, they all pull from a fixed amount…maybe?). Does anyone know or can point me in the right direction?

Reply
Terry
December 24, 2016 at 8:06 am
Just a guess, but the problem may well be a limitation of PAE in a 32 bit system. Even though more than 4GB RAM is recognised as installed, only up to 4GB per program can be used.

So if you have multiple instances of the same program running, then problems may arise if more than 4GB
is tried to be accessed. I guess multiple instances of a program is not the same as running different programs.

Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will be able to comment better than me !

Because Win10 only installed the driver for MS Basic Display Adapter for the pre-installed old NVidia GeForce GT120 I tried the latest NVIDIA-Win10-driver 21.21.13.4201 of 11-14-2016: Win10 w/o 4GB-patch booted but Win10 with 4GB-patch did not boot to the end.
The same effect was with 4GB-patched Win7 and the latest NVIDIA-Win7-driver (same version). I tested all available old Win7-driver from newest to oldest and at last 4GB-patched-Win7 started with the older NVIDIA-Win7-driver 9.18.13.3221 of 12-19-2013.
Because the oldest Win10-driver is of 07-29-15 (and so not old enough) I tried this Win7-version-9.18.13.3221 also with the 4GB-patched Win10 – and it worked. Surprise, surprise.

Hello Michael,

you asked for the difference between patchpae2 and 3.

Patchpae2 does not work on current win10. For current win10, patchpae3 is required.

If you can use patchpae2 without error message, your win10 is old.

Yes, it is Win10Pro 1511 build 10586.545.
But what is the substantial difference between the both programs? I know that patchpae2 modifies some byte in the kernel-file, changes the memory-limit. Does patchpae3 does the same, only at other places due to a updated and so different kernel-file?

I am not very surprised because patchpae3 modifies the same byte-sequences in the kernel-file as patchpae2 and in the same way and so the result should be the same.

But of course the problem with the NVidia-driver for GT 120 is the same – I have to use the old Win7-driver 332.21 (9.18.13.3221 of 12-19-2013). This is an origin problem of the driver, not an origin problem of the 4GB-kernel-patch, although this “bug” of the driver only appears with the 4GB-kernel-patch.

I have also tested it in an old Medion-PC with a MCI-7204-Motherboard, which can take 4GB RAM only. Surprisingly with and w/o the patch system reports only 3,35GB RAM. Seems as if some some-devices makes Windows to see only 3,35GB and not the actual 4GB. Strange. I hoped getting usage of the full 4GB RAM.

Hello @Michael
Could you write down steps that you performed when patching you Windows 10 built 14393.693?
I really appreciate it.

I have done the modifications exactly as described in the patchpae2-“manual”, with both PC (of course path and filename changed to patchpae3-location and -name) by copy&paste the commands to the elevated-command-window.
Additional I have also checked that the modifications of the kernel- and winload-file were done by comparing the original and modified files (I have used the “universal”-tool Total Commander for this).
When all the step are performed and the answers of the programs/Windows to each command are correct then Windows boots with the modified files.
I would suggest also compare the files and if the files are different (and so modifications are done) checking the new boot-entry with bcdedit or with EasyBCD (which is also helpful in many other cases).

For me, 14393.693 works fine with patchpae3. Installed RAM is 4GB.
With patch; 3,46GB usable.
Without patch: 2,47GB usable.

Using AMD A10-5700 with integrated ATI graphics.

Absolutely strange that
– you have this large difference between with and w/o patch AND even with patch not the complete 4GB RAM
– my old MCI-7204-MB shows 3,35GB with AND w/o patch.

You will never get 4GB of usable RAM with a 32 bit Windows OS even with PAE. Firstly an integrated graphics video adapter will take up whatever has been allocated in the BIOS, and then there is the RAM used for overheads.
With a separate graphics card up to around 3.5GB will be usable, maybe a little less depending on motherboard and the hardware you have. PAE may only give an extra 200+MB or less depending on hardware.

So, it is a moot point as to whether the PAE is worthwhile if only 4GB is installed.

Interestingly with 8GB installed on a patched win 10 machine and also on a patched win 8.1 machine, both with separate AMD Radeon (ATI) graphics cards, both report in ‘Properties’ that 8GB is installed, there is no statement of ‘usable ‘ memory.

This is not so easy, sorry.

With the MSI-7204-Motherboard and 4GB RAM System reports only 3.35GB RAM w/o message about availabe or useable RAM and doesn´t matter whether w/ or w/o the patch. And this although the MSI-7204 does NOT has Video onboard.

With the above reported HP p6029de (Motherboard Pegatron Benicia) and 4GB RAM (I have removed one 2GB-module) System reports w/o patch 4GB and useable 3.25GB RAM (Benicia has Video onboard, but disabled due to the used GeForce GT120). And with patch System reports the complete 4GB w/o any limitation to a smaller available/useable RAM.
It is the same bevaiour as with 6GB RAM: W/o patch System reports 6GB RAM existing and 3.25GB RAM useable, w/ patch 6GB existing.

So with the HP p6029de (Motherboard Pegatron Benicia) the patch really gives access to the “missing” 0.75GB RAM and so to the complete 4GB (if “only” 4 GB is installed).

I have another PC available for tests, a HP dc7900. I will test it this evening.

Hello Michael, well OK you are quite right, I had forgotten or got mixed up, a problem with 80 year old memory! With 4GB and system patched, 4.00GB is reported as installed with no mention of usable memory.

As regards the MSI motherboard, that is odd. Maybe run a memory test program like Memtest to see if it is all working OK ?

March 4, 2017 at 10:57 pm
The BIOS-test shows complete 4GB w/o problems. But “missing” 0.65 GB is not really disadvantegous. The PC/MB is old, is not really fast using Win7 or Win10 (when bought with WinXP nearly 13 years ago it was the highlight in our house, even with 512kB – tempus fugit), it´s o.k for emailing, writing and a little bit surfing, looking some vids on youtube etc., so far even the 3.35GB are not needed and used complete.

March 14, 2017 at 2:40 am
In the manual of the MSI-7204-MB I found the explanation, that due to the limitiations of the chipset not more than 3GB could be used. The truth seems to be that this chipset does not has the feature of “switching” the adresses of the RAM-area used by other devices (videocard etc.) into the area above the physical memory resp. the regular 4GB-adress-area. So is is a matter of the MB and it´s chipset how much of the 4GB can be used.

Nvidia Graphic Cards only works with 331.82 and earlier version driver.

I have NVidia Geforce 8400M GT (in laptop) (and latest Win 10 Build 14393) and got the “VIDEO TDR” blue screen using Patchpae3. Based on others having same NVidia issues with patch as well – I installed the oldest one I could find for Win 7 (as post suggested) – which was 8400M GT driver (10/23/2013 – 9.18.13.3165)
Win 10 will update that driver to the latest that doesnt work with patch. You have reboot without patched kernel then “roll back” via device managler.
This works most of the time about 90% – but still occasionally crashes and luckily reboots instead of those couple different blue screens.

THANK YOU EVGENY!

I have a computer running a PC3000 UDMA card for data recovery. It is an older card no longer supported by ACE Lab. There is no way in hell that will ever get a 64-bit driver. And i really needed more than 4GB RAM to be able to run another logical data recovery program at the same time with the PC3000 application, if i tried to run both one of them crashed after a few hours. The computer is running licensed Windows 7 Professional SP1 32-bit. Windows asked for reactivation after i changed the graphics card, but it verified the license no problem with just a couple clicks. So this patch can be run on a legitimate business copy of Windows.

I was able to patch the kernel and loader using your patch, and successfully installed another 4GB DDR3 memory stick and have 8GB RAM recognized and usable. There was a nVidia 8400GS Rev 3 graphics card in this PC, it started showing artifacts on the shutdown screen with 4GB after applying the patch, and completely crashed when i installed 8GB. I have removed the nVidia card and replaced it with an ATI Radeon HD5450. Installed the last driver version provided by AMD in 2016, the graphics card is fully functional without any issues. The computer behaves well now, and so far the data recovery applications have not crashed again.

Many many thanks, you have saved me a lot of frustration (and saved our clients time). I would like to donate a few bucks for your efforts. Do you have Paypal?

Are you talking about fix128 (aka patchpae3) or my mega link?

My is just fix128 encapsulated with autohotkey and a .cmd that executes it,
so unless fix128 contains something it will be the exact same thing …

On a side note fix128 is niw twice as big as previous versions,
but I think it just wasn’t packed with mpress or upx, however
when I encapsulated with purebasic it was also triggering a virus

PatchPAE3 is command-line utility. It’s PatchPae2 mod.
fix128 is GUI for PatchPAE3. It’s compilation of VBScript, 7zip, UPX and some Micro$oft utilities.
PAE Patch 2.1 by Escape75 is very simple… (GUI without GUI?) wrapper for PatchPAE3 to easy use.
PatchPae2.zip is not virus. It’s AV false positives heuristics, because any PatchPae modifies some windows critical kernel files just like virus. For example, when you run “PatchPae2.exe -type loader …”, you disable DRM, and Micro$oft and AVs worship DRM ??

Yeah I had another look and you’re right, these A/V engines are weird …

When I scan my PatchPAE.exe and PatchPAE.cmd separately they are clean (via virustotal.com)

When I scan PatchPAE 2.1 which encapsulates the 2 above using AutoHotkey I get detections (16!)
When I scan a test version of PatchPAE encapsulated with WinRAR SFX I get detections (8!)

The PatchPAE.exe in all of the above files is PatchPAE3.exe by evgeny.
So you get detections from all, but rest assured that PatchPAE 2.1 is clean.

AutoHotkey source code is also very simplistic:

Patch PatchPAE3 with Windows 15063.138 works fine for me. But I’m wondering:

“bootmenupolicy” is set to “Legacy” (checked with bcdedit /enum). The help of PatchPAE3 says:
“This will set our boot menu to classic text mode before loading drivers.”

But with new WIN10, boot menu is not the classic black/white text menu. It’s a blue (graphics?) menu. (Not always but usually.)

Is this normal?

Best regards

I found the difference:
During a “cold” start, the “classic text mode” (black/white) is used.
During a “hibernate” start, the blue mode is used.

It worked on Win 7 32 bit. Sp1 Home premium running on Virtual box.
My lesson was Make sure I follow the readme intructions exactly! I suggest extract the patch zip to root of drive ie C:\ seemed to work better than extracting into system 32 folder.
You will note in the read me that the path given to the loader is \windows not c:\windows as I mistakenly used. I’m not sure why that is but just use what the read me has.
If anyone little thing is wrong the loader wont work and as soon as you hit enter on the os selection screen it will go into windows recovery – dont give up! If you wait for the windows recovery to restart – and then select the same boot option again let windows recovery keep running untill it gives an error message – that will help alot – my error was cant find boot loader which helped me notice I had not followed the readme with the path. Note if you get a blue screen error thats different a driver possibly needs rolling back or an older driver installed (from what ive real mainly intel on board graphics)

Yay Now in computer properties it shows 6gb ram.

Figured out how to fix/workaround:
1) boot into original win kernel (original non-paepatch you should still have in boot menu) – let windows update finish installing
2) might reboot again, boot back into original non-paepatch windows
3) go into “control panel” -> “updates & security” — click “update history” — click “uninstall updates”
4) find “Security Update … (KB4025339)” – select it and “uninstall” it
5) let system reboot once
6) when back up after update has been uninstalled
7) open cmd prompt – goto “windows\system32\drivers” directory
8) copy pdc.sys pdc.sys.org
9) go back to “control panel” -> “updates & security” – watch and wait for windows to install the KB4025339 update again – let system reboot. startup will fail again so go back into the non-paepatch windows to complete KB4025339 install
10) go into “control panel” -> “updates & security” — click “Recovery” – scroll down to “Advanced” and click “restart now”
11) when it comes up in maintenace mode version – select “Troubleshooting” — then select “Advanced Options” — then select “commmand prompt”
12) when it comes up do:
d:
cd \windows\system32\drivers
ren pdc.sys pdc.sys.bad
ren pdc.sys.org pdc.sys
exit
13) now you should be able to select you default paepatched windows

## NOTE: ## — I found with this workaround — that now at this point with the old “pdc.sys” file back – that booting into the non-paepatched windows throws a bluescreen. So use at your known risk. since you keeping the new “pdc.sys” file you can always revert back.

– Let Windows make all updates to 15063.483. If windows makes a reboot, paepatch is not active.
– If windows updates are completely finished, re-apply PAE-patch !!!
– Then, you can set default mode to paepatch and use it.

I do not use Win10 regularily. But due to my experiences with Win7 and Win10 in the past it is not a matter of the win10-version but a matter of the nvidia-driver-version. The same problem occurs with Win7. I also do not exspect that a newer Win10-version would not accept the old Win7-driver. But at last with all this patches and improvisations and workarounds: There is no guarantee, make a try.

The differences between original and patched ntoskrnl.exe:

516179 8B 75 DC 85 F6 74 3F BE 00 00 02 00 90 90
5161A9 8B 4D FC 85 C9 74 06 B9 00 00 02 00 90 90

The replacements with “BE 00 00 02 00 90 90?/”B9 00 00 02 00 90 90” are well-know form the manually-done Win7-patch.
But what is the reason for replacing “FD D0 59” with “65 54 5A” ?

The differences between original and patched winload.exe:

original patched
00148 FE A3 4C AC
3AE06 8B F0 33 F6
3BE50 8B D8 31 DB

You may remember that when patching the Win7-kernel manually you must give the patched file ntkrlICE.exe a valid signature by using makecert.exe and signtool.exe and the commands:
makecert -r -ss my -n “CN=Microsoft Windows”
signtool sign -a -s my -n “Microsoft Windows” ntkrlICE.exe
I have done and testet this procedure with a manually patched ntoskrnl.exe and also with the patchpae3-patched ntoskrnl.exe. Although there was no error-message and so the signature should be o.k. the system does not boot but starts the repair-procedure (of course w/o success).
Any idea why this does not work with Win 10?

24-Jan-2018 On a 32-Bit OS Windows 10 Home Version 1709 Build 16299.192 with Integrated on CPU Graphic Card Intel HD-530, the PatchPAE3_2017_03_28.zip posted above works and Memory from 2GB went to 16GB, even if the Executable did NOT mention that supports Build 16299.

How can I determine if this is truly working on my system? I’m positive I followed all steps correctly, and dialogues seem to confirm. Upon reboot however, according to sys-info/sys properties it is not able to allocate more than 2.99 MB. Should I try the ntknew.exe command? I’m on the latest Win10 build (16299.192) and have a Lenovo x60 laptop. Perhaps there is a hardware conflict? Thanks, Randy

So then what you’re telling me is that although it should be working (I installed PAE3_2017_03_28), it appears that it is not. Without the benefit of any troubleshooting guidelines, I guess I must conclude that my x60 is not compatible due to a hardware conflict…

PatchPae3 worked fine nearly one year for me until February-Update KB4074588. Update failed several Times (0x800f0845).
So I selected the nonpatched-Entry as default from the Boot-Menu. Then after boot, KB4074588 was installed with now Problems.
I delete the old ntoskrnx.exe and winloadp.exe and created them new with

– PatchPae3.exe -type kernel -o ntoskrnx.exe ntoskrnl.exe
– PatchPae3.exe -type loader -o winloadp.exe winload.exe

In Boot-Menu I selected the patched-Entry as default again and booted: Everything works fine again.

Ignore it. Legacy boot menu option display boot menu before drivers will load in Windows 8/8.1/10 (Drivers maybe PAE-incompatible). Windows 7 has not such option, it has legacy boot menu only.

I just installed windows 7 with latest updates (kernel 6.1.7601.24094) on my VM, ran the script and after reboot with “Windows 7 with PAE” boot menu item got all of VM RAM.

Maybe your hardware can’t support PAE.

A few problems so far:
1) When I boot into Windows 10×86 and run the above Script Windows screams not on my watch and dumps me out without option. Full admin cmd and such.
2) OK, I figure replacing the kernal while booted in the OS might be a problem, I’ll just use my dual boot option and run it from there.
3) My dual boot is Windows 7×64 16GB dual physical single core CPUs. Running the script throws a x64 bit OS detected error and dumps me out. My XEON CPUs lack the commands necessary to run 8.1+ (believe me, I’ve tried).
4) OK, let me try compatibility mode. No luck.
5) My Windows 10×86 install is on F:\ in case that matters. I’ve got the patch files living in “f:\setup\PAE Patch”. Would the space matter?
6) The biggest problem I’m having is the readme files seem to have disappeared somewhere along the way making it hard to do the manual install. I’ll try an old one from PatchPae2 but this doesn’t feel right.
7) Any chance we can get the very top of this page updated to direct people down here? It took me rather too much time to find the current files.

>readme files seem to have disappeared
readme is part of PatchPAE3:

cmd.exe – > PatchPAE3.exe

output:
…
* print user guide for patch “4 Gb 32-bit memory limit”:
PatchPAE3.EXE -help unlock_pae

>When I boot into Windows 10×86 and run the above Script
you can edit script. you can comment first line (@ECHO OFF -> rem @ECHO OFF), then run cmd.exe and then run script to see commands output to determine problem line. or run script with argument ScriptPAE3.cmd NOUAC

the script is just good example. maybe it’s antivirus problem? and UEFI option “secure boot” can’t load patched (pirate) kernel/loader. maybe problem is in the script’s code page. and maybe you use non-standard windows loader.

>5 space matter?
No.

>5 install is on F:\
I think – no.

Cool. Having seen the readme unzipped from the top of the thread it never occurred to me to treat the patchpae3.exe as any other command line using standard dos help.

Aside from the exe downgrading my Xeons to i386s (inside joke for those who actually owned a 386 once upon a time) and some fat fingers it actually worked. It’s not super intuitive but as mentioned somewhere else, if you can’t translate these instructions yourself you shouldn’t be doing it.

Playing with the boot record gave me a third boot option with the patch while leaving my original install safely there in case it’s needed. Wasn’t expecting that piece of good fortune.

Viola. 16GB of ram shown, only 1.2GB used. Without memory hogs like Waterfox it may take me awhile to get programs to actually use that space, but I look forward to it with great anticipation.

I’ve accomplished what I came for and learned quite a bit (of trivia?) over the last few days. Thank you for your help.

1 Thing I don’t get.. you have a dual xeon machine with 16GB ram.. why would you WANT to run 32bit ? I’m not making fun.. just wondering.. might be some disturbing really old legacy software which was never upgraded etc.. I’ve seen some shit throughout the years believe me.. I’m even before the hayday of the 386dx.. waaay before ??

So basically I’m just really curious ?? non-judgemental style ! ??

Let’s talk W8CPUFeaturePatch. Is that really sane to do on my primary personal system? Are these newly required (dumb) commands really so obscure as to practically never execute? Will my system be stable if I do this? All I’ve ever wanted is a stable Windows 10×64 as God intended. Only now after I’ve got 16GB shown on Windows 10×86 does my forbidden fruit lie so tantalizing close.

Alas, my inadequacies lie in the form of PrefechW and LAHF/SAHF. Not mentioned in the patch instructions. Do I continue to come up short or have you magicians solved this problem too?

Confirming programs punch right through 4GB without complaint.

Weirdness, my hyperthreading turned off. It claims to be enabled on in the BIOS. Does some part of what we did turn it off? Firefox is hitting the CPU harder than anticipated. If I can’t get Hyperthreading back am I loosing cycles? Should I disable it in BIOS?

Next question, Microsoft never recognized my failed attempts years ago to upgrade this hardware to Windows 10 and never supplied a digital key for it to install. Not really fair, but I don’t have too much standing in court. There used to be many ways to complete a free and legal Windows 10 upgrade. Do any of these remain? I’m willing to install / uninstall / create partition / patch / etc. yet again if need be.

Thanks, it worked. But there are some strange things here:

After using your version, 2 new boot entries added to system:

Windows (PAE Patched) <- Default OS

The default entry "Windows (PAE Patched)" can't boot successful. The other one "Windows 10 (PAE)" worked.

Strange, my script will add “Windows 10 (PAE)” so the “PAE Patched” would be from another script.
You could use msconfig now and go under Boot and remove the other non-working boot entry.

Hello, I use Windows 7 32 bit with 8G RAM, this patch works fine except for USB such as printing to a printer connected to a USB port. I replaced USB related DLL files in \windows\system32\ folder with USB DLL files from Windows Server 2008 32bit Standard Edition’s evaluation ISO available in Microsoft web site, but the problem remains. This USB problem in PAEpatched Windows XP is solved by bringing USB DLL files from Windows Server 2003 32bit, but apparently not in Windows 7. My question is, 1)has anyone got USB to work reliably in PAEpatched Windows 7 32bit? 2)Does PAEpatched Windows 10 32bit have the same USB problem? Thanks in advance.

Thanks, I have found out that to root of the USB problem I described was partly with HP driver software. HP printers such as the Officejet 6000 works in PAE Patched Windows 7 by using print driver labeled “corprate”.

Non-corporate driver does not work in PAEPatched Windows 7 but it does in manually patched Windows XP. Similarly, HP printers for non-corporate consumers such as Deskjets do not have “corporate” driver, and do not work in PAE Patched Windows 7, but they do in patched Windows XP.
