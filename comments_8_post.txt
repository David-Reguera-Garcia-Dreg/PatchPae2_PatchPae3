As always awesome work, bit I don’t get the point why someone would use this hack to use more than 4gig ran instant of just installing the x64 version of windows?

There is often older software that simply won’t run on 64 bit versions. Not only software but hardware as well for specific business related applications. Not every PC is for browsing and gaming.

this is because 32 bit windows uses less memory. if you don’t believe, try installing x64 OS 1st and then afterwards an x86 of the same OS, but with all RAM unlocked, and just after formatting, just check the % of memory usage in task manager.
and that is the reason you will find x64 versions of softwares(like office 2013, or 2010, CATIA, ANSYS) are larger in size tha their x86 versions

x 86 is just faster, longer and more widely used. Supports more software. And honestly, it is x64, with the exception that x64 runs x86 twice for the most part.

AMD64/EM64T/x64/whatever-the-hell-you-want-to-call-it is a hell of a lot faster for 64-bit operations than x86 (*AND* more widely used). The cost, however, is that *everything* is 64-bit. Your pointers, your integers, your booleans, all regardless of whether or not you actually needed it.

If your application never needs the extended instruction length and memory space, then yes, you’re just wasting memory, but the moment you need something above 32-bit, 32-bit execution will suffer a severe performance hit. If you have ever used software that uses RSA encryption, or other stuff requiring bigints (Heard of SSL/TLS?) or just 64-bit ints (e.g. Rabbit/Badger, any browser whatsoever, …), then you will benefit from 64-bit.

x32 tries to remedy this – Can’t remember the details of it, though. I think it uses 32-bit pointers.

Probably because you use a desktop/note/netbook with integrated intel video, and all video drivers for intel video have limmitations when using it on Windows Vista/7/8.
See this blog posts to locate and read instruction to how download a xp driver that don’t have this limitation and install it on Windows Vista/7/8.

Hi folks, I have been using this patch successfully on Win7 and lately on Win8. I have however discovered that whereas on Win7 there was no issue, on Win8 the system fails to recover from Hibernate state when in PAE Patched kernel (hibernation recovery works fine when booted into the unpatched kernel). If anyone has any ideas to resolve this please share. Tks, Colin

Could it be that \Windows\system32\winresume.exe also needs to be patched in Win8? If so can anyone provide the instructions?

I have checked using Visual BCD editor and ensured that the GUID of the hibernate resumer for the PAE patched kernel corresponds to the GUID of the “AssociatedResumeObject” entry in the PAE Patched Loader. The issue persists – resume from hibernate works if booted into the un-patched kernel, but does not work when booted into the patched kernel. The same machine (a DELL E6420) does not have the issue with a Win7 Patched kernel.

Oh yay! I have been looking for a RAM patch for Windows 8 32Bit. I have Windows 7 x86 patched on my other HDD and it has NEVER given me any issues. I unfortunately had to upgrade to 8 to fix my Windows 7 after I screwed it up messing around with things. But having 8 in for a while I started to use it more often. And one thing that I noticed was that the system was once again stealing my RAM from me. So I called myself smart and ran the RAM patcher for windows 7 (in windows 7 mode) it completed but would not boot up again. So I stepped back in time and uninstalled it. Are you guys having any luck with this Windows 8 patch?

Also Im using a Dell Precision T5400 – 8 cores 4GB RAM (overclocked 2.00GHz~2.44GHz)
Do you think Dells have it rough for customizing like this? Or should it be smooth sailing?
Thanks,

This patch works fine in Win 8. I have tested it on DELL D630 and DELL E6420 so far. The only issue I have is failure to resume from hibernate (on both platforms). The developer of the patch has not confirmed this to be an issue with the patch as he has not been able to reproduce on his hardware. I am still working on trying to understand why the resume from hibernate does not work on my machines, but in the meanwhile I am simply not using hibernate – the rest works fine! ??

Hi all,

@WJ32, I have just run some tests and it appears that there is something strange happening since the April / May updates from MS. On a test VM running vanilla Win8 I can patch and unpatch at will. After running Windows Update the kernel patch returns a failed message whereas the loader patch continues to succeed. However, after reboot everything works as expected and on examination the new ntoskernx is present with a datestamp of 10/04/2013. The only anomaly I have seen is the failed message on the kernel patch operation, but it looks like the operation is in fact successful. Can you please look into this and comment?

Hi all, I tested today on a DELL E5400 with 4G of RAM (more than I had in the VM I used before). The command to patch the kernel does in fact fail, though a copy is still made. This means that the system boots using ntoskrnx, but since ntoskrnx is unchanged it is still subject to the 3.2G RAM limit…

@WJ32, any chance of an updated version please?

Colin I have a Dell E5420 also, with the i Core 5 cpu, though Im running Windows 7 x86. Have you any experience with this patch and Windows 7? I ran the other RAM patcher that I would always use to do so. And wouldn’t you know, for some reason, on my E6420 it wouldnt do it properly. It would run, say its complete. Then upon a restart, would boot up like normal, but at the screen where it should show your login info, its stays black. With no HDD activity. Im going to check right now on one thing. I DID change my login method to NOT show the last user to log in. So I want to verify that, that is not the reason. I’m interested in trying this patch, but I have to learn how to uninstall my current failed patch first.

Hi M8. I’m afraid I was unsuccessful in getting a previously patched Win 7 OS from a 6420 to work on the 5420 – same symptom you experienced despite numerous BIOS tweaks (which were pretty much random shots in the dark even if performed with method…). The system works fine on the standard kernel in both the 6420 and the 5420 chassis… I did not test from vanilla up as I don’t intend using Seven much any more and really don’t want to spend more time on this – sorry…

Dude you should hit me up. I couldnt get it working on my X86 W8 system. -.- But as for your situation, it should be fairly enough easy. Why dont you uninstall the updates , and run bleachbit and remove installer files and clean the reg , basically the deep clean feature, and reboot. Then you should be refreshed and able to re-install. I never let MS tech tuesday auto install. I would always come home to a blue screen. LOL
let me know if that works out for you. And once I get my system flowing steady again maybe you could give me a pointer or two to get it patched and moving.  ??

I have tested this on a physical machine (DELL D630). If you save your old kernel (ntoskrnx.exe) you can still use it after a failed patch operation against the newer version as long as you follow all the proper steps as outlined by the developer. In my case I simply made a copy of ntoskrnx.exe, re-patched to double-check – patch failed, the OS still booted to the new ntoskrnx, but naturally providing access to only 3.5G of RAM and not the 5G installed on this machine. I renamed the new kernel, renamed the old patched one back to ntoskrnx, rebooted and the OS can once again address all 5G. As mentioned in another of my posts, this scenario is not ideal since the older kernel does not benefit from the latest MS fixes and enhancements, but at least you can access all your memory, and nothing gets broken…

Nice buddy,
Thats what I do no matter the procedure. Ever since Windows introduced the concept of restore points, and my smarter than me friends always recommending to me to make redundant back ups of ALL my data. That concept of making a snapshot of what ever Im not sure of will break my system or not, before I modify it, is a standard practice. Plus learning about modding and bypassing and “cracking”, lets your mind grow and become more resourceful and creative.
Glad to see others doing the same. ?

Folks, please do not perform the patch on systems updated since March 2013 (using windows Update for example), since the patch will not work (if you do it correctly following the readme it wont break your system but you will be downgraded to 3.2 GB of RAM after the reboot). Previously patched systems will continue to function as before (addressing all of your RAM) even if you apply the Windows updates, as long as you do not re-patch your kernel (such systems will of course retain any vulnerabilities / issues that have been addressed in subsequent MS updates).

@WJ32, it seems MS did not like what you did for us and they have tried to close the door on us – could you please let us know if you have found / believe you can find another way in?

Im guessing that your laptop does not have a seperate GPU (grafix processing unit). So that alone CAN, but not always take anywhere from 64Mb up to 1Gb+ of RAM just to “function” normally. This I know from experience and research on my own, and from school. I just corrected my teacher on this subject in front of the class.  ?? If you can, change the amount of memory your hardware uses, you can do it in 2 places. One is a setting in the registry that addresses virtual memory allocated. It will NOT give you more RAM, but it increases the systems total virtual memory. Think of that as RAM combined with unseen Phantom RAM. It uses the page area on your HDD.
The other and Direct method is in your system BIOS. At power on, enter your BIOS, and look in your system config to see if there is a entry for video memory. Just remember the lower you go, the less you can do, because there will be less that you can see, literally. Certain games will not play with less than the desired amount of RAM. Certain formats of video will not decompress. Certain Windows programs will not be able to function with lower resources. Or they will just slow to a grinding slow speed similar to that of a 1GHz or so, processor.

If you want to utilize your little amount of RAM, I would use http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=damnsmall
Or
http://distrowatch.com/antix
or
http://distrowatch.com/slitaz

those are the smallest OS’s that I know of and have used. The last one for example is only 30Mb (the entire OS) and takes only 80Mb for a complete install. All three of those OS’s can be ran live. Meaning off of a Disc, with no install.

I hope that helps.

Hi Irfan, I am not a developer so do not have an intimate understanding of the mechanics of this patch (nor for that matter do I have the skill to comprehend the code even if I had the source). However, I do not think this is what you are looking for if you machine has less than 4 G of RAM. The purpose of this patch is to permit use of more memory than Win8 32-bit is officially designed to manage (i.e. typically 3 to 3.5 G depending on hardware reservation requirements). This patch is really useful if you need to run more than 4G of RAM (I am running 8) and you cannot or do not wish to use an X64 version of Win8. As for your OS declaring only 932 MB usable out of the 2G it can see this might need further investigation.

Ok, Ive successfully rewritten some of the code to work w/ both the older & newer kernel. Basically in the loop that compares the target & original code in the kernel, I have it skip 1 byte because I notice that one byte is different between the older kernel & the newer one. This does not mean, of course, that MS wont change some other byte again in the area … this patch looks for ‘pattern matching’ … heres the updated archive which has the new binary in root folder & modified source file
http://www.tempfiles.net/download/201306/307589/pae2.html

Ive also created a patcher which does all of the steps needed. I was using an older method for win7 & vista, before I found this script, which meant patching the MUI files as well. The script has an uninstall option when you run it with argument ‘uninstall’ (w/o quotes)

found a way out of a situation where the involved PAE kernel does not support the original remains in the cache through a search draw appropriate kernel patching treatable:

Microsoft Windows [Version 6.2.9200]
C:\Windows\System32>PatchPae2.exe -type kernel -o “C:\Windows\System32\20522.exe
” “C:\Windows\System32\20521.exe”
Patched.

[[ For Windows 8: ]]
6. bcdedit /set {e041b0af-ddd5-11e2-aeb5-8ef23a4a1248} kernel 20522.exe
This will set our boot entry to load our patched kernel.

that works as well, but ur still using an older kernel version. If you use my modified script(1st link if u dont want the autopatcher) it will work on newer kernel builds.

best script for all windows (vista, 7, 8). this will install only if you have 32bit os and if you have more than 3gb ram.
it is not add another boot entry. it replacing existing one so you can safely install
write following text to a note pad and save as “install.cmd” and placed on save folder contains “PatchPae2.exe”
note that script will shows error if you don’t run as administrator mode

@echo off

IF NOT %ERRORLEVEL%==0 (ECHO.& ECHO failed….

do not rush things, there is always a good alternative, as is 64-bit version of Windows 8.1 Preview, which only began to be tested on the client computers, although it can be said of a certain stability and speed kernel Smaller volume of occupied space on the system partition as compared to the previous uncle Bill’s development office …

Hi, installed beautifully on my machine, Windows 7 w/Sp1 but then I ran a ‘tweaker’ program that I believe turned my ‘patched’ loader to “forcedisablePae”, is that supposed to be so in our ‘patched’ loader? or is it ok to have it like that?Thanks in advance for your response and your fine work on this limitation in Windows 32 bit.

Hi wj32, I used this patch for my tablet but got problem. It’s a win8.1 pad, which is using Intel Atom z3770 cpu. According to the official description, seems it can only support 4GB memory. I guess maybe this patch is trying to patch to use 128GB, so failed on my pad. Can you help? Thanks in advance!

Trying this on Win7 32 bit SP1 on an older T2500 Core Duo system and it does not boot, getting Windows Loading Files which fails, then Repair menu. Patchpae2 says that both files patch correctly. System has ATI graphics and I thought that their drivers are ok. Any suggestions? Is the patch still valid with all the windows updates since last tested? Should I try a basic VGA driver rather than the ATI driver?

Sorry tried it again and it booted this time, I was able to see that everything is set up correctly with bcdedit /enum yet I see 4GB installed 3.5 GB usable. The 3.5 usable should be gone after the patch as I understand it. Any suggestions to determine if the patch is working?

Go back through the procedure and make sure your using “-type kernel -o ntoskrnx.exe ntoskrnl.exe” and not “-type kernel -o ntkrnlpx.exe ntkrnlpa.exe” which is for Win 7,probably the most common mistake.Also make sure your in c:/windows/system32 at the command prompt or it will not work correctly,take your time,follow the steps correctly,make sure you do them all correctly and you should be fine

Clear all aspects of this patch out, and go to here;http://news.saferbytes.it/analisi/2013/02/saferbytes-x86-memory-bootkit-new-updated-build-is-out/ ,scroll down to “download” and download and unzip..then install using the GUI interface. Have gone to this and I’m no longer getting any of the BSOD I was frequently getting w/the patch.Do install all of the updates for your operating system 1st,and it will install and run fine,even tells you in the ‘log’ file that they’ve to a non-standard’ loader and it takes care of that too.

Colin, Joshua, go to the page for Win 8.1
http://wj32.org/wp/2013/10/25/pae-patch-updated-for-windows-8-1/

and scroll down to the postings by evgeny November 23 2015 where you can download the latest patch for Win 10.

There is also a post further down by Escape75 on November 23 giving a link to an executable script file he wrote incorporating evgeny’s patch.
This works well, it installs the patch and does all the hard work for you.

It would pay you to read the various comments on this site concerning Nvidia video drivers which prevent the patch from working
